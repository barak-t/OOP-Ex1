####The Problem:
We would like that our algorithm allocate the elevators to reaching the best time for every passenger.
In order to get this results we have to took under consideration all its technical details, 
and the elevator position as a dependency our calls.
It's not easy to know where each elevator locates every time (because its offline algorithm) and this is our challenge.

<br />

####Algorithm:
Our algorithm check where is our elevators all the time by using all the technical details and its calls. 
The algorithm allocate calls to elevator. 
The calls select according to their distance from specific elevator and the elevator travel direction.
